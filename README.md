# HuffmanDecoder
Text Decoder and Encoder using the Huffman tree algorithm.

The Huffmann text encoder and decoder project was created for one of my computer science classes.

The project can take in a code book with the given character assigned to each bitstring and then decode any valid bitstring in O(1) time. The project uses a custom hash table and uses a code tree to allow the computer to decode any valid bitstring in O(1) time.

The BinarySequence class was created by Mark Nie and was edited by my professor Daniel Kluver. The file allows us to more easily read and manipulate strings of bits, the file was provided to us for this assignment. 

The FileIOAssitance class was created and provided by Daniel Kluver for this assignment to allow us to more easily read and write files as strings.

The ProvidedHufmannCodebook is a file that contains a series of characters, and their assigned bitstring values. This file was prepared by Daniel Kluver and was provided to us for this assignment.
